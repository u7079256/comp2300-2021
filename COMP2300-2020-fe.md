## 2. digital logic circuit question

The following digital logic circuit has three switched inputs (A, B, and C) which can be switched on (logical 1), and off (logical 0). The circuit has three output lights (red, yellow, and green), which light up when they receive a logical 1, and are off when they receive a logical 0.

Red = (A and B) nand ((A and B) or (not C)); Yellow = (A and B) or (not C); Green = ((A and B) or (not C)) xor (not C)

Which of the following options are true statements about this circuit? Select one or more.

- [ ] When A and B are switched on, only the yellow light is on.
- [x] When all switches are on, the yellow and green lights are on and the red light is off.
- [x] If B and C are switched off, then switching A on or off has no effect.
- [x] If C is switched off, it’s impossible for the green light to be on.
- [ ] It is possible to have all three lights turned on.
- [ ] Switching C on or off has no effect on any light.
- [ ] The yellow light will always be turned on.
- [ ] When B and C are switched on, the red light will be on.

## 3. interrupts

You’re debugging a new discoboard program and have set a breakpoint at the start of one of your interrupt handlers (on the first instruction of the handler, i.e., just after the label). After running the program for a while, the debugger stops at your breakpoint.

Which of the following statements are most correct about the execution state of your discoboard?

Select one or more of the following options:

- [x] The value in lr has nothing to do with the value of pc before the interrupt was triggered.
- [x] Before this interrupt was triggered, your discoboard may have been executing a different interrupt handler.
- [x] The interrupt connected to your handler has the numerically lowest valued priority of any currently pending interrupt, or interrupt being handled.
- [x] The previous value of r0 has been saved on the stack by the NVIC.
- [ ] Executing bx lr will return control to the main function of your program.
- [ ] The previous value of r6 has been saved on the stack by the NVIC.
- [ ] After returning from an interrupt handler, your program will have to restore r0, r1, r2, and r3.
- [ ] lr contains the address of the code running when the interrupt was triggered.
- [ ] Your program was informed by the NVIC that an interrupt was about to occur.

## 4. networks

You’re on a team developing a “discoboard to discoboard networking system” called disconet. You’ve been asked to come up with some arguments to justify particular design decisions at the next meeting and have brainstormed the following list.

Which of the following arguments are correct and should be presented at the meeting?

Select one or more of the following options:

- [x] disconet should be a serial protocol because keeping one connection synchronised could be simpler and faster.
- [x] disconet should use a packet switched network so that we can use data, rather than physical connections to address recipients.
- [x] disconet should implement a network layer so that discoboards can pass data without being the original sender or final receiver.
- [x] disconet shouldn’t be a ring topology, because if a discoboard runs out of batteries, the network will be broken.
- [ ] disconet should use TCP/IP because it implements the OSI standard.
- [ ] disconet only needs to define the application layer of the OSI standard as all the other layers are only related to hardware design.
- [ ] disconet shouldn’t use a star topology, because there will be no way to determine which discoboard to send a message to.
- [ ] disconet should be parallel because sending multiple bits simultaneously will always be faster and more practical.
- [ ] disconet should be circuit-switched because the discoboards are circuit boards.

## 5. OS

Which of the following statements about Operating Systems are true?

Select one or more of the following options:

- [x] System calls are used when a user program needs to ask the kernel to perform certain actions.
- [x] Operating systems are normally in charge of allocating memory to each running program.
- [x] Linux uses a hybrid monolithic and modular kernel.
- [x] The Unix operating system uses files to represent data as well as devices.
- [ ] The Unix operating system uses a microkernel.
- [ ] System calls are used when the kernel needs to ask user programs to perform certain actions.
- [ ] First-come first-served scheduling means that the average waiting time for a process will be as low as possible.
- [ ] Once a process is running, it will remain in main memory until it has completed execution.

## 6. twiddle

Given that the following lines of code have just been executed:

```(Assembly)
ldr r0, =0xCAFED00D
ldr r1, =0x0
ldr r2, =0x1
ldr r3, =0xFF
```

Which of the following lines of code leaves a number in r5 with bit 6 set (considering the bits to be zero-indexed, so bit 0 is the least-significant bit in r5).

Select one or more of the following options:

- [x] ror r5, r0, #6
- [x] sub r5, r1, r2
- [x] orr r5, r0, r2, lsl #6
- [x] mov r5, r3, lsl #3
- [ ] mvn r5, r3
- [ ] orn r5, r0, r3
- [ ] adds r5, r0, r2
- [ ] and r5, r1, r0, lsl #6

## 7. number of instructions

You’re leading a team designing a new CPU instruction set architecture (ISA). One team member has suggested an ISA consisting of 2864 instructions but another colleague has designed an ISA with only 178 instructions.

At a recent meeting, both colleagues tried to convince you that their design was better and, together, they have given you a list of arguments (see below).

Which of the arguments are valid and should be taken into account when finalising your CPU’s ISA? Select one or more of the following arguments:

- [x] Having more instructions is better as it will allow programmers to optimise code for special situations, resulting in faster programs.
- [x] Having fewer instructions is better as it means programmers will have to use simpler instructions that are faster to execute.
- [x] Having more instructions is worse because op-codes will have to be longer, and having longer instructions means that programs take up more memory.
- [x] Having fewer instructions is worse because programmers will have to use more instructions to accomplish the same task, so programs will take up more memory.
- [ ] Having fewer instructions is better because it will take the CPU less time to search for each instruction, so execution will be faster.
- [ ] Having more instructions is worse because it will make high-level programming languages more complex for programmers.
- [ ] Having more instructions is better because the CPU will be able to express more algorithms.
- [ ] Having fewer instructions is worse because transistors on the CPU will be wasted.
- [ ] The number of instructions needs to be close to a power of two (e.g., 256) matching the bus-width of the CPU, so only the smaller ISA will work.

## 8. pipeline hazard question

You’re working on a development team for a new discoboard with a pipelined CPU and come across the following function:

```(Assembly)
down_under:
    ldr r0, [sp]
    ldr r1, [sp, 4]
    push {r4-r12, lr}
    mov r4, 32
L1:
    bl plunder
    cmp r0, r4
    bge L2
    bl thunder
    b L1
L2:
    ldr r5, =vegemite_sandwich
    ldr r2, [r5]
    add r4, r0, r0
    add r1, r1, r0
    sub r3, r2, r1
    bl take_cover
    mov r0, r3
    pop {r4-r12, lr}
    str r0, [sp]
    str r1, [sp, 4]
    bx lr
```

Right after the function, you can see some notes made in comments by another developer. Which of these comments is correct? (You can assume your team members have followed correct calling convention).

Select one or more of the following comments:

- [x] The line bge L2 presents a control hazard.
- [x] The lines add r1, r1, r0 and sub r3, r2, r1 are a data hazard.
- [x] The line ldr r2, [r5] can be moved down in the function to resolve a data hazard.
- [x] The line bl take_cover presents a data hazard.
- [ ] The line bl thunder is a structural hazard.
- [ ] Loading data from the stack (ldr r0, [sp]) is a data hazard.
- [ ] The line ldr r2, [r5] can be moved up in the function to resolve a data hazard.
- [ ] The line cmp r0, r4 is a structural hazard as r4 could have been changed by the function plunder.

## 9. Even or not in memory

Write down an ARM assembly function starting at the label even_or_not that performs the following operation on a 32-bit parameter x which is found in memory at location 0x20000000.

If x is even, then return 2∗x; Otherwise, return 2+x.

The output value should be written to the same memory location where x was found.

```(Assembly)
even_or_not:

  ldr r0, =0x20000000
  ldr r1, [r0]

  if:
    tst r1, #1
    beq then
  else:
    add r1, 2
    b remaining
  then:
    mov r2, 2
    mul r1, r2
  remaining:
    str r1, [r0]

  bx lr
```

## 10. Iterate over array

You’re part of the team designing a discoboard-powered calculator which can store 32 32-bit signed integers at a time in an array (the array is stored in packed format at 4-byte boundaries).

Given that the first entry in the array is stored in statically-allocated memory at the label *discovector*, write a function to calculate the average (rounded down to the nearest integer) of the 32 numbers in the array.

Add a comment to explain where the return value is stored at the end of the function call.

```(Assembly)
average:
  ldr r0, =discovector
  mov r1, #0
  mov r2, #0

  for_determinant:
    cmp r1, #32
    beq for_end

  for_body:
    ldr r3, [r0, r1, lsl #2]
    add r2, r3
    add r1, #1
    b for_determinant

  for_end:
    @ the average value is stored at r0
    udiv r0, r2, r1

  bx lr
```

## 11. fibonotchi series

The consider the following definition for a series of numbers:
F0=2, F1=3, Fn=Fn−1+Fn−2

Write a recursive function, starting from the label *series_n*, which takes one argument, n, and calculates the number Fn.

```(Assembly)
series_n:

  str lr, [sp, #-4]!

  cmp r0, #0
  beq base_case_1
  cmp r0, #1
  beq base_case_2
  b recursive_case

  base_case_1:
    mov r0, #2
    b return

  base_case_2:
    mov r0, #3
    b return

  recursive_case:
    str r0, [sp, #-4]!
    sub r0, #1
    bl series_n
    mov r3, r0
    ldr r0, [sp], #4
    str r3, [sp, #-4]!
    sub r0, #2
    bl series_n
    ldr r3, [sp], #4
    add r0, r3

  return:
    ldr lr, [sp], #4
    bx lr
```

## 12. networks sync async

Serial connections can be synchronous, where a clock line connects both ends of the connection, or asynchronous, where there is no clock line.

Explain why a clock line is useful for transmitting data between two computers and how an asynchronous serial connection can work without a clock line. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches.

***Answer:***

Not covered in Semester1, 2021.

Asynchronous serial connection means no clock line is required for data transmission. Data is surrounded by starting bit and ending bit.

Stncrhonous serial connection means clock line is used during data transmission.

## 13. OS question privilege levels

The ARMv7-M architecture supports two privilege levels for code execution: privileged and unprivileged.

Regular code can run at either level, while interrupt handlers always run in the privileged level.

What are the purposes of these privilege levels? Explain how they would be useful for implementing an operating system.

***Answer:***

Not covered in Semester1, 2021.

## 14. why ldrex strex

A programmer working on software for a multi-tasking operating system is editing the following function called strike_one which is designed to subtract one from a value held in memory:

```(Assembly)
strike_one:
    ldr r2, =taskcount
    ldrex r3, [r2]
    sub r3, r3, #1 @ subtract one
    strex r4, r3, [r2]
    cmp r4, 0
    bne strike_one
    bx lr
```

The programmer has used the ldrex and strex instructions. Explain why the programmer has used these instructions. What situations might make these instructions necessary and how these instructions help.

***Answer:***

It means that "ldrex" and "strex" (inclusive) part is the critical part of this process. If there is a context switch to another task and breaks the program between ldrex and strex. The value in the memory labelled with taskcount might be changed by another task. Then, when we jump back to this task, we should load the latest value from the momery rather than simply continue to operate. Otherwise, we might use the old value in the memory. So, we need some ways to help us determine whether the critical code part in the program have been split by other tasks. When jumping back to this process, we need to make sure we have loaded the latest value from the memory. Programmers could use mutual exclusion lock.

Mutual exclusion instructions are useful for synchronization in concurency execution of different processes which use shared memory. By surrounding the critical code part with the ldrex and strex, the strex would work only when ldrex is executed just before strex (no context switch in between) If there is a context switch, the store operation will fail and return a non-zero value. When we detect a non-zero return value, we could do the process again.

## 15. Flynn Taxonomy

Flynn’s taxonomy of CPU architectures has four categories:

```(Text)
SISD (single instruction stream, single data stream), 
MISD (multiple instruction stream, single data stream), 
SIMD (single instruction stream, multiple data stream), and 
MIMD (multiple instruction stream, multiple data stream). 
```

Explain each category and discuss how such a CPU would be useful (or not useful) to a programmer using examples.

***Answer:***

SISD: The original Von Neumann Architecture that does not employ any kind of parallelism. The sequential processor takes data from a single address in memory and performs a single instruction on the data. e.g. All single processor systems are SISD.

SIMD: A single instruction is executed on multiple different data streams. These instructions can be performed sequentially, taking advantage of pipelining, or in parallel using multiple processors. e.g. Modern GPUs, containing Vector processors and array processors, are commonly SIMD systems.

MISD: In this architecture multiple instructions are performed on a single data stream. An uncommon type commonly used for fault tolerance. Different systems perform operations on the data and all the results must agree. e.g. Used on flight control systems where fault detection is critical.

MIMD: Multiple autonomous processors perform operations on difference pieces of data, either independently or as part of shared memory space. e.g. Most modern  desktop / laptop / mobile processors are MIMD processors.
