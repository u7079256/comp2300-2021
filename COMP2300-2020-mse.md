## Q1

All four addressing models help programmers to manipulate data inside memory.  

In terms of **base only**, it is the simplest way to store/load data. For example, using ***ldr r0, [r1]*** would direcly load the value in the memory with address ***r1*** to ***r0***. It is used when we know the exact address of the required data in the memory.  

In terms of **base plus offset**, we can store/load data near the given address. For example, ***ldr r0, [r1, 8]***, would load the value in the memory with address ***(r1+8)*** into r0 without changing the base address r1. It can be used when we need to access memory nearby the base address without having to calculate the new address first, and when we don't want to change the value of the base address after the load/store process.  

In terms of **pre-indexed**, we would access the memory after calculating the new address with offset. For example, ***ldr r0, [r1, #8]!***, firstly we get ***r1 := r1 + 8***, then we load the value in ***r1*** into ***r0***. The offset is calculated before the load/store process and the address will be updated. It is widely used in the stack operations. When we need to push data into stack, we need to firstly move ***sp*** down ***4*** units (to create spaces for storing data) and then store the data. (e.g. ***str r0, [r1, #-4]!***)  

In terms of **post-indexed**, we would access the memory of the base address and change the value of the address after load/store process. For example ***str r0, [r1], #8***, it would store value ***r0*** into ***r1***, and add ***r1*** with ***8***. It is widely used in the stack operations when we need to pop data from the stack. We firstly load the data out of the stack to the register and add move up ***sp*** with ***4*** units to delete it from the stack. (e.g. ***ldr r0, [r1], #4***)  

Each mode is useful, but we can express some modes with other modes. Below is the example how we can express **base plus offset**, **pre-indexed**, and **post-indexed** solely using **base only**.  

    ldr r0, [r1, #8]
    @ is equivalent to:
    add r1, #8
    ldr r0, [r1]
    sub r1, #8  
  
    ldr r0, [r1, #8]!
    @ is equivalent to:
    add r1, #8
    ldr r0, [r1]

    ldr r0, [r1], #8
    @ is equivalent to:
    ldr r0, [r1]
    add r1, #8  

## Q2

    .type square_or_half, %function
    square_or_half:
      if:
        cmp r0, 10
        bhi then
      else:
        mov r1, 2
        udiv r0, r0, r1
        b remaining
      then:
        mul r0, r0
      remaining:
      bx lr  

## Q3

    @ a is stored into r0
    mov r0, 12
    @ i is stored into r1
    mov r1, 0
    while_det:
      cmp r1, 10
      bhi while_end
    while_loop:
      add r0, r1
      add r1, 1
      b while_det
    while_end:
      nop  

## Q4

In terms of how stack works, there is a special register called ***sp*** (stack pointer). The stack is part of memory in SRAM part of the discoboard and ***sp*** is the memory address pointing at the top of the stack. The stack is the last in first out stucture. Thus, the last value being pushed into stack would be the first value when we pop elements from the stack. When we push data into the stack, the stack pointer will move downwards and then store data into that memory address. When we pop data from the stack, the stack pointer firstly load the data into the register and move the ***sp*** upwards.  

To manipulate stack, programmers can use

    @ push single value (r0) into stack
    @ decrement before for creating spaces to store data
    str, r0, [sp, #-4]!

    @ pop single value (r0) out of stack
    @ increment after for deleting data from the stack
    ldr r0, [sp], #4

    @ push multiple values (r0-r2) into stack
    @ decrement before for creating spaces to store data
    stmdb sp!, {r0, r1, r2}
    
    @ pop multiple values (r0-r2) out of stack
    @ increment after for deleting data from the stack
    ldmia sp!, {r0, r1, r2}

Stack is useful while compiling high-level programing languages. When a function calls another function, it has to store the current context (local variables, current link register, framepointer etc.) to the stack and run the callee function. When finished running the callee function, we can load the context back and continue running the caller function. We don't have enough registers to temporarily store the context, and using stack can help us store and track our data in the momory. Besides, in Assembly programing, as suggested by the function calling conventions, we are not allowed to modify values in ***r4-r11*** after calling a function. However, we might want to use more registers inside a function. So, we can temporarily push values to the stack and pop them back to the register before exiting the funtion.

    @ Example of why use stack
    .type main. %function
    main:
      mov r0, 10
      mov r4, 50
      bl func1
      b main
    
    .type func1, %function
    func1:
      stmdb sp!, {lr, r4}
      @ do something to change lr and r4...
      bl func2
      ldmia sp!, {lr, r4}
      bx lr
    
    .type func2, %function
    func2:
      @ do something to change r4...
      bx lr

## Q5

Programmers assume that the Assembly function calling conventions are held during the ***add_three_numbers*** and ***calculate_factorial*** function. As suggested by the calling convention, ***r0-r3*** are for function parameters and scratch area, and ***r0-r1*** are for return values. So, value in ***r4-r11*** are expected to remain after exiting the function call.  

At the beginning of ***hard_yakka***, we move value ***21*** into ***r5*** in line 5, and then did a bunch of instructions (calculations, moving values, calling functions). The calculations and value movement don't interact with ***r5***. If these two functions obey the AACPS, then value inside ***r5*** won't change and thus ***21*** in ***r5*** can be used in the last several lines of ***hard_yakka***.  

## Q6

Generally, this method could work but is problematic. The range of the 8-bit 1's complement form signed integer is **[-127, 127]**. The potential problem is that there are two zeros, one "positive" 0 (0b00000000) and a "negative" 0 (0b11111111). This would  be contrary to mathematical rules. If we solely want to represent signed binary numbers without applying it in mathematical calculations, this encoding can be used.  

    @ For the new signed integer encoding
    0b00000010 = #2
    0b11111101 = #-2
    0b00000010 + 0b11111101 = 0b11111111 = #-0

    @ The problem can happen when we add 1 to -0 (C flag set)
    0b11111111 + 0b1 = 0b00000000 => #-0 + #1 = #+0

    @ Another problem
    0b00000010 = #2
    0b11111110 = #-1
    0b00000010 + 0b11111110 = 0b00000000 = #+0
