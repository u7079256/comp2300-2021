my_pledge: >-

  I am committed to being a person of integrity.

  I pledge, as a member of the Australian National University community, to
  abide by and uphold the standards of academic integrity outlined in the course
  policy, the ANU statement on honesty and plagiarism, and I am aware of the
  relevant legislation (see links below).

  I commit & push this file to GitLab to indicate that I understand these rules
  and the consequences of breaching them.
